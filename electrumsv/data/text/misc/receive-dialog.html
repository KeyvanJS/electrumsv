<h2>The Expected payment dialog</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Provisional in-wallet help</i></p>
<p>
The Expected payment dialog is used to both view and edit existing incoming payments for the
selected account.

The Receive tab is used to declare to the wallet that the user expects an incoming payment to
be received at some point. Unless the user has declared this to the wallet, the wallet will not
look for the payment and will never know about it. For this reason the user must click
the <cite>Create</cite> button before a payment destination is reserved and made available to them
to give out.
</p>

<h3>Sharing payment details</h3>
<p>
Once an expected payment has been created, it is useful to share it with whoever is going to
pay it. There are several ways this can be done.
</p>
<h4>Copy payment link</h4>
<p>
This button copies a <cite>bitcoin:</cite> style link. This link includes all the relevant
details including the description, and the BSV amount. This is a BIP21 style link.
</p>
<h4>Copy the payment destination</h4>
<p>
This can either be done by selecting the text in the <cite>Payment destination</cite> field
and copying it the same way you would with any other selected text, or you can click the
copy button on the right hand side of the field. This copies the shown payment destination
whether it is an address or a BIP276-encoded script in the case of accounts that cannot use
addresses.
</p>
<h4>The QR code</h4>
<p>
The QR code encodes the payment link, and using a device that can scan the QR code, it is expected
that the device can process that link.
</p>

<h3>Payment fields</h3>
<h4>Account</h4>
<p>
Because it is possible for an expected payment dialog to be open for a different account other
than the currently selected one, we show the account that the expected payment belongs to.
</p>
<h4>Payment destination</h4>
<p>
This is the assigned key for the given payment. If the account is the type that uses addresses
it will be shown as an address, otherwise it will be shown as a BIP276-encoded script.
</p>
<h4>Description (required)</h4>
<p>
The <cite>Description</cite> field describes the expected payment so that the user can
distinguish it from any of their other payments.
</p>
<h4>Requested amount (optional)</h4>
<p>
The <cite>Requested amount</cite> field if empty, represents an incoming payment of unknown value
or perhaps the user cannot be bothered to fill out a value. If a value is provided, then the
expected payment will not be closed out until either sufficient payments are received to meet that
value, or the expiry period has passed. Address reuse is considered to lower privacy, so it is
recommended that anyone paying pay as one single transaction and not multiple, unless a separate
expected payment is created for each transaction.
</p>
<p>
If fiat is enabled for the wallet two fields will be shown here, both BSV and the selected fiat
currency. If fiat is not enabled, then only the BSV field will be shown here.
</p>
<h4>Request expires</h4>
<p>
This currently describes the expiry period of the payment. It cannot currently be edited.
