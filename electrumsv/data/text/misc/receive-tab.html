<h2>The Receive tab</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Provisional in-wallet help</i></p>
<p>
The Receive tab is used to declare to the wallet that the user expects an incoming payment to
be received at some point. Unless the user has declared this to the wallet, the wallet will not
look for the payment and will never know about it. For this reason the user must click
the <cite>Create</cite> button before a payment destination is reserved and made available to them
to give out.
</p>
<p>
It is not recommended that users declare expected payments that do not expire. This will make the
user's wallet vulnerable to attacks where they are sent unsolicited payments which might be
intended either for tracking or contain malicious material of an illegal nature. The user should
quarantine any such funds and avoid spending or using them in any way.
</p>
<h4>Description (required)</h4>
<p>
The <cite>Description</cite> field is there to tell the user what the payment is related to,
perhaps noting who it might be from.
</p>
<h4>Requested amount (required)</h4>
<p>
This <cite>Requested amount</cite> field is for both the user's records, and also for the wallet
software to use in matching payments. Detected incoming payments to the reserved payment
destination will count towards this amount, and the payment state will be toggled to "Paid" if
they are of sufficient value.
</p>
<h4>Request expires (required)</h4>
<p>
This <cite>Request expires</cite> field ensures that the wallet only observes the reserved payment
destination for a limited amount of time. This ensures that the wallet is not left consuming
resources monitoring this payment destination indefinitely, which may in the long run cost the
user to access the APIs necessary to do so, and slow down the operation of their wallet.
