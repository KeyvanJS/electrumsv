  Project Lead: Roger Taylor
  Language: Python (>=3.10.0)

What this branch is currently for
---------------------------------

The master branch on Github is linked to as the go-to place where we
store build hashes. If you want to run ElectrumSV from source, perhaps
because you use Linux, you must use the `releases-1.3` branch.

Do not use the `develop` branch. This is not supported and includes
wallet database changes that we will not help you with should you
run that branch.

The future of this branch
-------------------------

We will be deleting this branch and renaming the `develop` branch to
`master` when the `develop` branch is stable enough to work with.
